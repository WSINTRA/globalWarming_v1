      Most of the time they are cooling down water \n that is used in the process\n \
      of generating electricity. \n It is in fact steam blowing out of the tower."

      That's right, back in time during the 1940's\n \
      the US government congress passed laws to encourage \n\
      the building of federal owned hydroelectric dams \n\n\
      Today these dams make up a collection of 22 man made lakes\n\
       across the South East USA.\n\
      \n\
      They help to prevent flooding and harness \n\
      the renewable power of water to produce electricity"
