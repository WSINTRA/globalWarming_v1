      infoText: "Did you know that these towers we see all around our landscapes\n are not actually polluting our ozone layers. \n They are typically used at power stations \n \
      Most of the time they are cooling down water \n that is used in the process\n \
      of generating electricity. \n It is in fact steam blowing out of the tower."

      infoText: "Did you know we get a lot of our electricity from lakes\n \
      That's right, back in time during the 1940's\n \
      the US government congress passed laws to encourage \n\
      the building of federal owned hydroelectric dams \n\n\
      Today these dams make up a collection of 22 man made lakes\n\
       across the South East USA.\n\
      \n\
      They help to prevent flooding and harness \n\
      the renewable power of water to produce electricity"

    infoText: "Did you know that in the US we throw away \n\
    35 billion plastic water bottles every year.\n\
    Interestingly it takes between 500 and 1000 years\n\
    for plastic to degrade.\n\n\
      A whole lot of that plastic makes it's way into waterways\n\
    like this one."

    name: "Wooden Construction",
    infoText: "Did you know that wood from managed forests actually stores carbon\n\
     as opposed to emitting it: as trees grow, they absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n\
     Structures using wooden materials also tend to be quicker and easier to build,\n\
      therefore reducing labour costs, transport fuel and on-site energy use. "

    name: "Demolition",
    infoText: "Did you know that concrete dust released by building demolition \n\
    and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution \n\n\
    In the year 1993 a US government funded report approximated that\n\
    almost 17% of worldwide landfill was a by-product of concrete based waste."
